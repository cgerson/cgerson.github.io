At a PyData Meetup last week, some fellow classmates and I were introduced to <a href="https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre" target="_blank">Spyre</a>, a framework for creating data-driven python web apps. It's the simplest way I've found to launch a dynamic web app and not touch HTML or javascript... some days just aren't HTML/javascript days, y'know?

### Follow me

I've been playing around with Spyre for a week now. Here are the basic steps to make an app happen:

1) First, know some python (or copy my code blindly).

2) Install Spyre:

   $ pip install dataspyre
   
3) Open a script file in your favorite editor. The file name doesn't matter. Let's call it apptlynamed.py.

4) Each Spyre file needs five basic things to get running:

#### Import the module

```
from spyre import server
```

#### Create the App class

```
class SpyreApp(server.App): #inherits the server.App class
```

#### Inside your class, define your inputs

```
    inputs = 	 [{ "type":"text", #specify input format. this is a textbox
                  "key":"words", #'words' is the key we will use to refer to value, below
		  "label":"write words here", #label for the textbox (optional)
                  "value":"hello world", #initial value
                 	  "action_id":"update_data"}] #tells Spyre what to do when value is entered
```

#### Inside your class, define your outputs

```
     outputs = 	 [{"type":"html", #tells Spyre to use getHTML file to generate output
                 "id":"update_data"}] #needs unique id
```

#### Launch

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
     app = SimpleApp()
     app.launch(port=8000) #or the port of your choice
```

5) Copy and paste those five blocks, in order, into your script file.

6) On the command line (in the app's directory), type

   $ python apptlynamed.py
   
7) Open your browser and go to localhost:8000. App's up!

Notice that Spyre outputs the following text:
"<b>Override</b> the getHTML method to insert your own HTML <i>here</i>"

Let's do that. Inside the SpyreApp class, underneath your outputs, copy the following:

```
	def getHTML(self, params): #argument params allows you to access inputs
            words = params["words"] #params is a dictionary. grab value entered in textbox with the key 'words'
            return "Here's what you wrote in the textbox: <b>%s</b>" % words #return a string
```

And, add a title above your inputs:

```
	title = "Spyre Example"
```

Basic app, <b>finished</b>.

### More outputs

Spyre works with pandas dataframes to create tables, and matplotlib to graph data from those tables. You know those packages and you've mastered them (along with the art of stack-overlowing those damn axes formatters), so, relief.

When we introduce more outputs, we'll introduce more variables and modify our outputs variable. We'll need <i>tabs</i> to separate the outputs, as well as a <i>controls</i> variable to control the output flow depending on which tab we're on. Also, in our outputs variable, we'll need to add a <i>control_id</i> attribute. Check out some sample code: 

```
	tabs = ["Plot","Table"] #names should not have spaces here

     	controls = [{"control_type" : "hidden", 
		   "control_id" : "update_data"}] #name of control_id doesn't matter, as long it matches the outputs

     	outputs = [{"output_type" : "plot", #tells Spyre to use getData file to generate output
		  "output_id" : "plot",
		  "control_id" : "update_data", #matches 'controls' control_id above
		  "tab" : "Plot"}, #match our tab name
		  {"output_type" : "table", #tells Spyre to use getPlot file to generate output 
		   "control_id" : "submit_plot",
		   "output_id" : "update_data", #matches 'controls' control_id above
		   "tab" : "Table"] #match our tab name
```     

Then, just like we overrode the "getHTML" method earlier, we'll override "getPlot" for plot output and "getData" for table output. They'll need to return a matplotlib figure and a pandas dataframe, respectively.

Spyre's creator Adam Hajari has a number of illustrative examples on his <a href="https://github.com/adamhajari/spyre" target="_blank">github</a>. I suggest reading through his tutorials, as well as running his code and playing around with the options.

I recently deployed a <a href="http://twittyre.heroku.com" target="_blank">Twitter Sentiment Analysis app</a>, using Adam's guide to <a href="http://adamhajari.github.io/2015/04/21/deploying-a-spyre-app-on-heroku.html" target="_blank">deploying Spyre on Heroku</a>.
