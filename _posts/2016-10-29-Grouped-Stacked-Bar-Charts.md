title: Clusters of Stacked Bar Charts

Tis the season to visualize election results!

Today I sent in my absentee ballot (Howdy, Texas) and set up a module to <b>chart survey results based on respondent demographic data</b>.

In particular, let's make a chart with Python's <a href="http://matplotlib.org/index.html">matplotlib</a> plotting library to see -- <b>which candidate are each gender and each age group leaning towards?</b> The module has got other applications, so I thought I'd share it here.
