title: Clusters of Stacked Bar Charts
---

Tis the season to visualize election results! Today I sent in my absentee ballot (Howdy, Texas) and set up a module to chart survey results based on respondent demographic data. In particular, let's make a matplotlib chart to see -- <b>which candidate are each gender and each age group leaning towards?</b> The module has got other applications, so I thought I'd share it here.
